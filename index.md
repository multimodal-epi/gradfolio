# Bio
Jason R. Singson is an applied epidemiologist trained in Emergency Preparedness, Infectious Disease, Health Equity, and Community Research. With over 8 years of experience at local and state health department combined with over 5 years of applied epidmeiology experience, Mr. Singson brings a great deal of expertise into the world of public health, epidemiology, and government. Through his personal and community experiences with COVID-19, he took an active role in organizing for policies that promote a healthier Filipino community here back in the Filipinos and abroad through [Kapwa Health Collective](https://instagram.com/kapwahealthsf). He plays an active role in shaping the practices of Applied Epidemiology through the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

His methods and data are grounded through his Filipino community, Catholic social teaching and liberation theology, allyship and solidarity, and social justice in the hopes of creating a society that serves and benefits all. In his free time, you can see him bowling, experimenting with different coffee beans, and starting a track and field race.

He holds the golden rule of track and field starters in all aspects of life: "No athlete is allowed to gain an unfair advantage, and no athlete should have to suffer an unfair disadvantage."
