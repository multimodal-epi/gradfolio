# Bio
Jason R. Singson is an applied epidemiologist trained in Emergency Preparedness, Infectious Disease, Health Equity, and Community Research. With over 8 years of experience at local and state health department combined with over 5 years of applied epidmeiology experience, Mr. Singson brings a great deal of expertise into the world of public health, epidemiology, and government. Through his experiences with COVID-19, he took an active role in organizing for policies that promote a healthier Filipino community here back in the Filipinos and abroad through [Kapwa Health Collective](https://instagram.com/kapwahealthsf). 

His methods and data are grounded through his Filipino community, Catholic social teaching and liberation theology, allyship and solidarity, and social justice in the hopes of creating a society that serves and benefits all. In his free time, you can see him bowling, experimenting with different coffee beans, and starting a track and field race.

He holds the golden rule of track and field starters in all aspects of life: "No athlete is allowed to gain an unfair advantage, and no athlete should have to suffer an unfair disadvantage."
